  from keras.layers import Dense, Input, Dropout, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Flatten, Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Activation, MaxPooling2D

```
  - <code>Keras: </code> It is a high-level neural networks API that provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training deep learning models.
  - <code>Layer: </code> It is a module in the Keras library that provides various types of neural network layers, such as convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers.
  - <code>Dense: </code> A Keras layer that implements a densely connected neural network layer, in which each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.
  - <code>Input: </code> A Keras layer that defines the input shape of a neural network.
  - <code>Dropout: </code> A Keras layer that implements dropout regularization, which randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training to prevent overfitting.
  - <code>GlobalAveragePooling2D: </code> A Keras layer that performs global average pooling over the spatial dimensions of a 2D feature map, resulting in a single feature vector for each channel.
  - <code>Flatten: </code> A Keras layer that flattens a multi-dimensional input tensor into a single dimension.
  - <code>Conv2D: </code> A Keras layer that performs 2D convolution on an input image or feature map, using a set of learnable filters.
  - <code>BatchNormalization: </code> A Keras layer that normalizes the input to a neural network layer across the batch dimension, improving the stability and speed of training.
  - <code>Activation: </code> A Keras layer that applies an activation function element-wise to the input tensor.
  - <code>MaxPooling2D: </code> A Keras layer that performs 2D max pooling over the spatial dimensions of a feature map, reducing its spatial resolution while preserving its channel depth.</br>
These layers are commonly used in building convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Importing them with the from keras.layers statement allows you to use them in your code.

```python
# Your Python code here
  from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

```
By importing <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> using the statement <code>from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator</code>, you can create an instance of the class and use its methods to generate batches of augmented image data for training your deep learning models. This is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy and generalization of your models, especially when you have limited training data.</br>
  - <code>preprocessing</code> is a module in the Keras library that provides various data preprocessing utilities, such as image data augmentation and sequence padding.
  - <code>Image</code> is a submodule of preprocessing that contains functions and classes for working with image data.
  - <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> is a class in the image submodule that generates batches of augmented image data for training deep learning models. It can apply a variety of random transformations to input images, such as rotation, shear, zoom, and flip, to increase the diversity and robustness of the training data.
 ```python
# Your Python code here
  from keras.models import Model, Sequential

```
By importing <code>Model</code> and <code>Sequential</code> using the statement <code>from keras.models import Model, Sequential</code>, you can create instances of these classes and use them to define and train deep learning models. <code>Sequential</code> is a good choice for simple models such as <b>MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs</b>, while <code>Model</code> provides more flexibility and customization for complex models with multiple inputs and outputs. The Keras library also provides various pre-trained models such as <b>VGG, ResNet, and Inception</b>, which can be imported from the <code>keras.applications</code> module and fine-tuned for specific tasks.</br>
  - <code>models </code>is a module in the Keras library that provides various types of pre-defined model architectures and functions for constructing custom models.
  - <code>Model </code> is a class in the models module that represents a generic Keras model, which can have multiple inputs and outputs, and can be built using the functional API.
  - <code>Sequential </code> is a class in the models module that represents a linear stack of layers, where each layer is connected to the previous one. This type of model is simpler to define and train than a generic model, but is limited to architectures that can be expressed as a simple feedforward neural network.
 ```python
# Your Python code here
  from keras_preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array

```
  - <code>keras_preprocessing</code> is a Python module that provides image preprocessing utilities for the Keras deep learning library.
  - <code>load_img</code> and <code>img_to_array</code> are two functions provided by <code>keras_preprocessing.image</code> module.
  - <code>load_img</code> function is used to load an image from a file path and return a PIL (Python Imaging Library) image object. It takes two arguments: the file path and an optional target size. If the target size is provided, the image is resized to that size during loading.
  - <code>img_to_array</code> function is used to convert a PIL image object or a Numpy array to a Numpy array with shape <b>(height, width, channels).</b> This function does not modify the input image or array.

```python
# Your Python code here
  from keras.optimizers import Adam, SGD, RMSprop

```
These optimization algorithms are used to optimize the loss function of a neural network during training, by finding the set of weights that minimize the loss function.</br>

  - <code>Adam: </code> Adaptive Moment Estimation. It is a popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm that computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters.
  - <code>SGD: </code> Stochastic Gradient Descent. It is a classic optimization algorithm for updating the weights of a neural network during training by computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and updating the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient.
  - <code>RMSprop: </code> Root Mean Square Propagation. It is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each weight based on the average of the magnitudes of recent gradients for that weight.
